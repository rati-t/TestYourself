# TestYourself
  Just my junk do not roast me for that, That was actually my second project.
  I mean i have been learning React and Redux, but i did not, because it is 
hard to understand, so i have realized that the procces of me trying to 
reach goal teaches me more than watching video that explains something 
endlessly, so i decided to start doing something by myself or watch less 
stressfull videos where boys are doing some real "shit".
